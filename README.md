# Surfs Up
For this module, we have been analyzing weather data in Python loaded from a SQLite database. The database contains weather readings from multiple stations in Oahu, Hawaii. We have been tasked with analyzing this data in preparation of possibly opening a fictitious shop called 'Surf n' Shake'.

## Overview
For this week's challenge, we have been tasked with analyzing temperature trends for two months on the island of Oahu, June and December. Our invester would like to confirm if the temperatures will be high enough to support the surf and ice cream shop business year-round.
